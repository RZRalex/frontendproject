tasks:
[x] complete media queries

A really good project it definitely had me working to get everything to run right. 
It never came at me 100% visualized, changed to the grid format for the main content,
the media queries became a major hurdle until I set solid parameters. I believe there
is several lines in the CSS that could be cleaned up but everything works as it should
for now. The button:hovers we're fun to make at the end!
