# **Frontend Project: Photo Gallery Website**

This project was made to demonstrate standard page layout, styling, and responsive web design with no frameworks to rely on.
This was a web fundamentals project to show comprehension on HTML and CSS.
From making this mock up site I learned to organize each block of a webpage into respective areas so that they can adjust to screen sizes big and small. Using flexbox to make the transitions easier and hover styling to add effects felt exciting to pick up and make a webpage into a small experience.
I used all of my own photography as the images in this site that could technically be the real front page to my photo website if I so chose.


## Notes

A really good project it definitely had me working to get everything to run right. 
It never came at me 100% visualized, changed to the grid format for the main content,
the media queries became a major hurdle until I set solid parameters. I believe there
is several lines in the CSS that could be cleaned up but everything works as it should
for now. The button:hovers we're fun to make at the end!
